//To transfer to the Beaglebone use following command and compile on the beaglebone
scp -r bb_code root@192.168.7.2:/root
// note: transfers entire directory!
// note: reconfigure target tty device before compile!


//To run on remote system (i.e. as the Beaglebone) use following command:
mkfifo /tmp/f ; cat /tmp/f | ./a.out -q | /bin/sh -i > /tmp/f 2>&1
// note: ./a.out is the compiled program. If you compiled the program under a different name, change ./a.out accordingly!


//To compile the program, use the command:
g++ -lpthread *.cpp
